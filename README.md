# MLE-Estimation-of-GARCH-Model-in-Matlab
1. Implemented MLE estimation for GJR-GARCH (1,1) model in MATLAB and test the implementation by            conducting size and power analysis using simulated data generated from MATLAB built-in functions
2. Built a parsimonious GARCH model for a time-series data from Bloomberg and conduct post-estimation      analysis such as checking residuals, robustness by sub-diving the sample period
